            <h2>This is what it took to get here.</h2>
            <p>To the reader seeing this, I invite you to explore the journey of transformation and growth that lies ahead.
                Although not everything is fully fleshed out yet, I am committed to sharing my experiences and stories as I navigate through the path of goodness and healing.
                This is a work in progress much like myself and I hope that by sharing my journey, I can inspire others to find their own paths to becoming better versions of themselves throughout
                trials of trauma and grief.
            </p>

            <p>To those who have stayed despite my complexities, thank you for your patience and support.
            <br><u>I remember you through every step of my journey. </u>
